So you have decided to contribute to the CGI US West Chicago/Minneapolis Metro CW Portal project.  Thank you!  Here are a few things you need to know in order to get started.

Local setup

The CW Portal microservices are hosted on Pivotal Cloud Foundry.  In order for you to deploy microservices, you will need the following:

* An account on Pivotal Web Services (run.pivotal.io).  Contact Jerry at jerry.hagen@cgi.com to get an invite to our PWS organization.
* An instance of the Cloud Foundry CLI (Command Line Interface).
